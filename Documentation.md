#### Documentation needed:
 * User documentation possibly (tutorials for students). May not be useful as code will be changed by 9 dots staff
 * System documentation (for teachers/developers at 9 dots)
 * Project overview (short summary of why it was created, similar to readme)
 * Design decisions (include with project overview, for 9 dots, but not vital as is subject to change)
