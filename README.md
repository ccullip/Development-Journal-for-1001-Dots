Meeting time: Tuesday and Thursdays 9:30AM
Scrum meeting - what is accomplished, what will be accomplished by next meeting, blockers (what is stopping you from doing what you need to do)
Email Community Partner (cc Justin and Chloe)

Plan for community partner meeting
Questions:
What do kids in the age range have the most issues with in the transition?
What does the current system look like?
Should it be online or be downloaded (VS Code? Ace?)
Do you want integration or separate platform?
How do you imagine it looking?
Any additional instructional features on the editor plug-in besides the template?
How is the switch from block-based to text-based currently implemented?
Should there be levels of difficulty?
What language are the students using at the moment/what should we use?
What is the average expected skill level for students in the age range?

Figure out what we’re creating and how we’re going to implement the web page or web editor.
Make code
Block based (unbreakable)
Monaco (currently Ace)
Abstract syntax tree
Build as module (node) npn
Design sprint on functions
    
Project summary:
We are to implement a webpage using Microsoft’s Monaco editor in typescript that utilizes drag-and-drop blocks. The blocks will consist of coding areas such as if statements, functions, and loops. Certain parts of the code in the editor will be read-only and will result in an error if the user attempts to make changes. We are planning to implement:
Online Monaco editor
Blocks
Error Messages
Read-only parts of code
Search Function
Auto-complete
