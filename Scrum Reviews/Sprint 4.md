## What we were planning to do:
* adding block on the cursor position using parser
* deleting blocks by highlight the whole block using parser
* auto complete function

## What we have done:
* wrote most of the functions to add and delete block
* switched to recast
* auto complete is partially working (the whole block shows up after typing "if")

## What we couldâ€™ve done better:
* working on test cases and make more documentation (continuous integration test)
* better communication
