### What we were planning to do:
* minimum viable product
* coloring parts of code
* make if statement uneditable
* parser
* user stories

### What we have done:
* basic blocks
* html formatting
* parser (kind of)
* detect backspace

### What we couldâ€™ve done better:
* better task assignment and definition
* better communication
* more development of user stories
* documentation

### What was not done, and why?
* user stories, just because.
* make if statement uneditable, have to understand parser and ast first.
* coloring parts of code, would probably need parser as well.
