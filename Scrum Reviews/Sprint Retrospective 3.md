### What went well?
We got the block addition to be automated by the dictionary and are working with the parser.

### What didn't go well?
Errors in Esprima.

### What have we learned (about working as a group)?
Group work is hard.

### What should we do differently next time?
Delegate tasks so group members are working on similar but different parts of the project. Test cases, functions, parser, etc.

### What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?
Remind every member to work on the project. Better communication between group when we get stuck on a part.
