### What went well?
* Got adding and deleting to work for the most part
### What didn't go well?
* Group shrunk in size
* Deleting doesn't work when unparseable (how to fix this???)
### What have we learned (about working as a group)?
* Everyone has to contribute/communicate for the group to function
### What should we do differently next time?
* Not sure if this is something we can control
### What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?
* How to delegate tasks and finish the project with 2 people instead of 4
