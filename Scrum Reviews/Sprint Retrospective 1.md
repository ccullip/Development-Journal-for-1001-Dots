### What went well?
We got the editor working locally. We have schedules.

### What didn't go well?
However we aren't following the schedules exactly.

### What have we learned (about working as a group)?
Everyone has to hold everyone else accountable, and everyone should be open and available to communication.

### What should we do differently next time?
We should delegate tasks more instead of assigning a general goal that everyone should work towards.

### What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?
A time that works for everyone to meet for Scrum meetings. Better communication with all group members.
