### What went well?
* Made some progress on overall project, worked on some documentation
### What didn't go well?
* The second week was hell week (aka didn't have much time to work on project)
* Group communication
### What have we learned (about working as a group)?
* Really understanding the problem to fix helps with coding 
### What should we do differently next time?
* Talk through logic completely to help with coding and understanding flow of functions
### What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?
* N/A
