### What we were planning to do:
* Read-only blocks
* Delete entire block
* Auto-complete function
* Color parts of editor

### What we have done:
* Automate adding html buttons using dictionary
* Integrate Esprima/Escodegen/Estraverse

### What we couldâ€™ve done better:
* User stories (UX audit, etc)
* Putting in more time

### What was not done, and why?
* Auto-complete function, not sure (Plamen isn't here)
* Color parts of editor, not as important, got stuck
