* How did the user testing/feedback session go? What did you expect to learn? What did you actually learn?

  The feedback session went alright. Since Josh was not present when we visited 9 Dots office, we talked to Daniel instead.
  Daniel does not know the exact details of our our project, so our meeting was more of a getting a feel for the 9 Dots office
  and get familiar with the kind of work they do. Overall it was worth it, but not totally up to what it expected the meeting 
  to be because we didn't get all the information that we wanted.
  
* What, if anything, have you learned about interacting with real clients on real projects?

  I realized interacting with real clients on real projects can be difficult because there can be last minute changes. However,
  I don't think it is too bad since we are working with a client who knows about computer science stuff. I can imagine what it
  will be if we had a client who doesn't know anything about programming.
  
* Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?

  I had been hoping this project would be on sync with our plan, and we would implement many features in just a couple of
  weeks. But it turned out that what we were trying to achieve were a lot harder than we thought that some of us are stuck,
  and most of us didn't put in enough time to solve the difficulties.
