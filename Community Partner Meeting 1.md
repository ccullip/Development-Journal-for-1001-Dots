## Notes from Daniel

* Possible areas to protect: for loops, while loops, if statements, parentheses, and curly braces are the most important
* Possibly use a repeat function instead of a for loop (better for middle school and early high school)
* How to delete parts of the code (if curly braces are protected, how should the whole block be deleted?)
    * Highlight whole block, click at beginning of block, need something intuitive
* Ability to add blocks and scaffold at will by 9 Dots (group blocks as well)
* Ability to make certain parts of code read only or all of it editable for more advanced coders
* Make parts of for loop uneditable (like semicolons inside expression part) but allow other parts to be edited
* Error checking and colors/design not as important right now but in the future possibly should be implemented
* Insert blocks just by editing dictionary (autonomize the program)
* Use a parser (esprima? recast? escodegen?) to get locations of keywords??

## Remaining questions
* Should we use Recast or Esprima/Escodegen? (Escodegen seems to only allow reformatting? Ruins comments and whitespace)
* Does Josh agree with the top priorities for read-only?
* Most important part to focus on right now is to figure out the parser?
