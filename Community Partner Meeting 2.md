### Questions for Josh:
* How to add blocks if cursor is in middle of forbidden region (add before? add after? don't add at all?)
* How he's planning to use the project after the semester
* Undo button/Parse during enter (right now, if a '/' is typed after a statement, cannot backspace because it's unparseable)
*
