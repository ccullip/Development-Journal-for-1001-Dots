### Questions for Josh:
* How to add blocks if cursor is in middle of forbidden region (add before? add after? don't add at all?)
* How he's planning to use the project after the semester
* Undo button/Parse during enter (right now, if a '/' is typed after a statement, cannot backspace because it's unparseable)
* How close to his original design is it right now?
* How to possibly implement auto-formatting? At least for future groups. (How far? like just identation, or full auto-syntaxing)
* What are some concerns you would think some students or teachers would run into?
* What part of this project do you think is the most important that we take away from this? (More of a question for Justin, but from Josh would be nice)
* What do you think is achievable in the time we have left?
*
