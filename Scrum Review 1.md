What we were planning to do:
  - we were planning to do the design sprint where we make a minimum viable product
  - Get code working on all computers
  - Design the basic layout of the website
  - learn basic JavaScript
  - Creating user stories
  
  
What we have done:
  - creating viable product (we got the code running locally on some of our computers)



What we couldâ€™ve done better:
 - Set smaller, more realistic goals; focus more on the editor and design
 - Estimate the time needed for each specific goal
 - Communicate within group better (assign tasks to each group member & have due dates set)
